~ (Alt + 126) = Home Directory

pwd = present work directory

dir = ls

ls -al (extensive display)

cd /c/windows/system32/

cd ../../.. (allow us to go back certain levels in the root path)

which ls (enlists the resources that are located in root path)

echo "Hello Matrix" (echo works as the <Python.print> command)

echo $PATH (displays the root path where you are positioned)

echo "The current path is $PATH"

echo "Hello Matrix" >> demo.txt (This way we can create a file with content within)

cat test.txt (allow us to display the content of a file)

less text.txt (Allow us to access and edit the content of a file, then press "q" to exit

touch demo.txt (Touch allow us to create a new document) && (anytime I use the touch command the timestamp of the file is updated, so if you run the <ls -l> command you will the timestamp is more recent. 

mv demo.txt demo-1.txt (rename a file/directory from demo.txt into demo-1.txt)

rm demo-1.txt (allow us to remove a file)

mkdir projects (allow us to create directories)

rmdir projects (there is just one condition before removing a directory, the file must be empy otherwise youÂ´ll get an error)
rm -rf (remove recursive force allow us to delete all the content which is inside a directory)

mkdir (allow us to create directories) && (you can create multiple directories as follows: mkdir Jan Feb Mar Apr, etc...in that way you will create 4 new directories)
mkdir -p projects/MonteCarlo/2025/January/February (alternatively, <mkdir -p> allow us to create in one sigle instruction a tree of files)

clear (clear the screen)

exit (exit from Git Bash)

./ example.sh (allow us to see the file content from the terminal)
